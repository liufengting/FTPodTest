Swift version of FTPopOverMenu.

# FTPopOverMenu

[FTPopOverMenu](https://github.com/liufengting/FTPopOverMenu) is a pop over menu for `iOS` which is maybe the easiest one to use, supports both `portrait` and `landscape`. It can show from any `UIView`, any `UIBarButtonItem` and any `CGRect`. Simplest APIs, enable you to change the style in one line of code.

* Images in the demo from [https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/pokemon-go](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/pokemon-go).
* If you like it, or maybe wanna use it in your own projects, please give me a `star`.
* Looking for another way of doing this? Take a look at my another [FTPopMenu at here](https://github.com/liufengting/FTPopMenu).  It was another way of showing pop over menus, which is wrapped from `UIPopoverViewController`, and more genetic and more good-looking. Feel free to try it.
